This project, titled "Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning," aims to develop an automated system for predicting diabetes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. By leveraging various supervised learning algorithms and neural networks, the project seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diabetes diagnosis. The system is designed to reduce the subjectivity and delay associated with traditional manual diagnosis by providing quick, data-driven insights. It includes modules for data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, culminating in a user-friendly interface for
